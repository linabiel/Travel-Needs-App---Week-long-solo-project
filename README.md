## Travel Needs

The app Travel Needs helps Oscal Wilde, Peter Parker and Me to track our dream destinations: places we visited and palces we still want to travel to.

## Tools Used: <br/>
  HTML/CSS <br/>
  Python <br/>
  Flask <br/>
  PostgreSQL <br/>

## MVP: <br/> 
  The app allows the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited <br/>
  The user can create and edit countries <br/>
  Each country has one or more cities to visit <br/>
  The user can create and delete entries for cities <br/>
  The app allows the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see <br/>

## Extensions: <br/>
